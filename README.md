## Why collecting benchmark result from player is useful?
I'm not criticizing but there are limitations for general reviewers who might play or not the game.
At the same time they simply can't using esport settings for their reviews of product. Or they have not transfer their reviews to CS2 version of the game yet. 
Also, if they are getting started benchmarking new component using CS2, they are going to choose whether test huge amount of data for old hardware, or just pick some iconic ones, which is less useful for general player who don't upgrade their PC yearly. 

An example, Techpowerup still use CSGO FPS Benchmark for their 14th gen review:

It is also need to be considered that daily driving machine is not background application free. More cores might not effecting FPS in reviews, but will effect real life situation.





## How to benchmark?
Use this workshop map: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3240880604

## How to submit result?
### You can..
New an issue, list your result in this way:

1 CPU

1-1 if Overclocked/Tweaked, what frequency or power setting you are running at? (which is optional, if not OC then do not include)

2 GPU

2-1 if Overclocked/Tweaked...

3 RAM Speed and important timings, if XMP then just give freq.+XMP.

3-1 if...

4 Avg FPS/P1 FPS

### Or
Send email title started with CS2 Benchmark result + *Date of benchmark* to uubxar7dl@mozmail.com

## What graphics setting and resolution should I use?
### Submit one of the choices, but MORE is BETTERRRR
1. Result of your own combination favor, such as 4:3 1280x960 with your own graphics settings. (you do not need to specify your settings but you can)
2. Native 16:9 1080P/1440P/2160P with Maximum Preset (Recommended, 1080P is best)
3. Native 16:9 1080P your settings with Fidelity FX SuperResolution set to Performance

### My recommanded setting for weak GPU is 
Player contrast: ON

V-Sync: off

Anti aliasing: CMAA2

Global Shadow: High

Model/Texture detail: Low

Texture filtering: Bi

Shadow detail: Low

Pactical detail: Low

Ambient occlusion: Medium

HDR: Performance

FSR: Disable

Reflex: Enable+Boost

## Example for submitting result:
1 Ryzen 5 7600

1-1 PBO on

2 RTX3080

2-1 Undervolted, GPU gaming frequency at 1800Mhz

3 DDR5 5600XMP

4 

4-1 1080P + Overall low graphics settings: 458.1/182.5

4-2 1080P + Overall low graphics settings + FSR Performance: 472.5/197.6

4-3 1080P Maximum: 336.8/151.2
