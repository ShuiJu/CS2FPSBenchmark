## How to submit result?
### You can..
New an issue, list your result in this way:


New an issue, list your result in this way:
1 CPU

1-1 if Overclocked/Tweaked, what frequency or power setting you are running at? (which is optional, if not OC then do not include)

2 GPU

2-1 if Overclocked/Tweaked...

3 RAM Speed and important timings, if XMP then just give freq.+XMP.

3-1 if...

4 Avg FPS/P1 FPS

### Or
Use pull request.

## What graphics setting and resolution should I use?
### Submit one of the choices, but MORE is BETTERRRR
1. Result of your own combination favor, such as 4:3 1280x960 with your own graphics settings. (you do not need to specify your settings but you can)
2. Native 16:9 1080P/1440P/2160P with Maximum Preset (Recommended, 1080P is best)
3. Native 16:9 1080P your settings with Fidelity FX SuperResolution set to Performance

### My recommanded setting for weak GPU is 
Player contrast: ON

V-Sync: off

Anti aliasing: CMAA2

Global Shadow: High

Model/Texture detail: Low

Texture filtering: Bi

Shadow detail: Low

Pactical detail: Low

Ambient occlusion: Medium

HDR: Performance

FSR: Disable

Reflex: Enable+Boost
